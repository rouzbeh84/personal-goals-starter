Personal Goals
==============

Personal goals made open source.

Why? Spending the time to get shit done. I'm open sourcing these goals for accessibility across computers I use, transparency, accountability, and versioning.

# Overarching Goals
1. Contribute to Open Source
2. Write more blog posts
3. Use my brain more
4. Get better at LIFE
5. Learn about Bundlers
6. Be kind
